# audacity - snap version on 24.04 LTS is two years behind
#    the deb version : 3.4.2 (Apr 2024) deb vs 3.1.3 (Sep 2022) snap. This may change in
#    the future. Additionally, the audacity snap also requires running
#    `sudo snap connect audacity:alsa` for proper permissions and feels slower.
# vlc - currently installed via apt
gimp

# Messengers
# discord - discord tends to break; their updates don't work with Snap
