Bootstrap-Machine
=================
Configures a new Linux installation as I like it. 

For now this doesn't do much, and I imagine it'll remain hackish. I'm
writing this as I'm performing a few complete reinstallations. For now this
just does Ubuntu, but I might add Arch support soon.

The aim is to be idempotent, so that it could theoretically be run even on
older installations.

Features
--------
- Installs packages in `packages.txt`.
- (Nothing else yet)

TODO
----
- Pull down and build certain things from source.
- Download and configure Chromium and Firefox extensions, settings, etc.
- Download and install dotfiles.
